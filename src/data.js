    eventBlurb:
      "Dr. Kisho Tsuchiya and I have organized the 3rd Reconceptualizing the Cold War workshop from the 14th to 26th September 2020, in which we discussed eleven papers that focus on diverse local experiences of “social warfare” in different places of Southeast Asia. Due to the COVID-19 situation, this workshop was held virtually by utilizing Google Docs. We read one paper a day, and exchanged 35-100 comments per paper. The workshop also enabled scholarly exchanges with our local research collaborators who had been working on our digital oral history archive project in the Philippines and Indonesia. The project team is aiming for a follow-up workshop and an edited volume in the future based on the series of workshops since 2019.",
